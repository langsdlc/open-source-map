##Instructions for finding a youtube video for your map

* Find a video of Berlin in [youTube](https://www.youtube.com/) or any other source with a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) license. For example, [St. Nicholas' Church, Berlin, Germany](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlPfgi8xHw) by Igor Skoglund.

* Click Share.  Click Embed.  Copy the embedded url: ```<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uKlPfgi8xHw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>```

* Edit the link width to 180 and delete the height variable.  You will also want to delete the 's' from 'https:' and add a double quote around your code.  Make sure all of your code matches the following format with slashes as well.  For example : ```"<iframe width='180' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/uKlPfgi8xHw' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe>"```

* Find the Latitude and Longitude of the video you want to use with [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/St+Nicholas'+Church,+10178+Berlin,+Germany/@52.5168424,13.4074785,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47a84e20c2c2a4a7:0x73bc4247163b5be8).  Make sure you are using decimal degrees.

* Copy a "feature" from the existing GeoJson. For example,
    
* Edit the GeoJSON to reflect the information about your new point and image. Be sure to include official title and authorial credit in the description of the image. For example,

 ```json
   {
  "type": "Feature",
  "properties": {
    "title": "Berlin Victory Column",
    "series": "Spring 2016",
    "tour": "1920",
    "marker-size": "medium",
    "marker-color": "#3366FF",
    "marker-symbol": "star-stroked",
    "images": [
      [
        "<iframe width='180'  src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/H4wnh2osfGI' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe>",
        "Siegess√§ule, Berlin. Each of the three original columns represents a victory over the Danish, a victory over the Austrians, and a victory over the French."
      ],
      [
      "<img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Kanzler21a.jpg/320px-Kanzler21a.jpg' />",
      "This is a picture of the new chancellary."
      ]
    ]
  },
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [
      13.3725,
      52.5186
    ]
  }
}
```


* After saving everything, you should be ready to add your point to the map database using the Postman directions!
